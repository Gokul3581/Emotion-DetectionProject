# Real-Time Emotion Detection Platform
A real-time emotion detection system built from scratch using deep learning techniques. This project independently analyzes facial expressions and text-transcribed speech to classify human emotions, and demonstrates the results through a web-based interface.

This project focuses on recognizing emotions in real-time through two parallel models:

Facial Emotion Recognition using a custom CNN.

Text-Based Emotion Detection from transcribed speech using a Transformer-based model.
